  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, cook ground beef over medium-high heat until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it
      cooks.</li>
    <li>Add chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
    <li>Stir in marinara sauce and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and let sauce simmer while you prepare the
      cheese mixture.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.</li>
    <li>Spread a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top of
      the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the layers, starting with the meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Top the final layer of mozzarella cheese with the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves, if
      desired.</li>
